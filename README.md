ðŸ¤– Tic-Tac-Toe AI with Minimax & Alpha-Beta Pruning

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python where a human player competes against an unbeatable AI opponent. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to make optimal moves.

ðŸ“Œ Features

Human vs AI gameplay

AI uses Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning for efficiency

Clean and interactive command-line interface

Detects win/loss/draw after each move

Fully functional 3x3 game board

ðŸ§  How It Works

The AI (playing as 'O') uses the Minimax algorithm to simulate all possible future moves and chooses the optimal one. Alpha-Beta Pruning is applied to reduce the number of unnecessary branches evaluated, making the AI fast and efficient.

ðŸ•¹ Gameplay

You play as 'X', AI plays as 'O'

Input your move as two integers: row col (e.g., 1 2)

The board is indexed from 0 to 2


Example:

You are 'X'. AI is 'O'.
-------------
|   |   |   |
-------------
|   |   |   |
-------------
|   |   |   |
-------------
Enter your move (row and col 0-2):
âœ… Requirements
Python 3.x
No external libraries are needed.

ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe-ai.git
cd tic-tac-toe-ai

2. Run the game:

python tic_tac_toe_ai.py

ðŸ§ª Algorithms Used

Minimax Algorithm: Explores all possible moves and selects the optimal one by maximizing the AI's chances of winning and minimizing the human player's.

Alpha-Beta Pruning: Enhances the Minimax algorithm by cutting off branches that don't need to be explored, improving efficiency.
