🎯 CodSoft Internship – Task 1 Completed
🕹 Tic-Tac-Toe AI using Minimax Algorithm

As part of my internship at CodSoft, I developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game with an unbeatable AI using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning.

🔧 Tech Used: Python
🤖 AI Type: Minimax-based Decision Maker
🎯 Goal: Make the AI unbeatable against a human player

🧠 Key Concepts Learned:

Game Theory & Optimal Strategy

Minimax Algorithm & Alpha-Beta Pruning

Recursive Search Tree Exploration

Command Line Game Development


👨‍💻 How it Works:

Human plays as 'X', AI plays as 'O'

The AI always picks the best move

The game checks for win, lose, or draw after each turn


📌 Output Example:

You are 'X'. AI is 'O'.
-------------
|   |   |   |
-------------
Enter your move (row and col 0-2): 0 0
...
AI is making a move...
